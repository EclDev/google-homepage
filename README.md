In this project I am attempting to create a basic copy of a google search results page. It will have no JS functionality and no "fany" features like drop down menus etc. This is to test my basic knowlege of HTML and CSS. By the end of this project I should hae a good grasp of:

-Two ways to move a div around on the page
-Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
-Identify the background color of an existing webpage
-Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
-Center an element horizontally
-Three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page
-Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
-Build a very basic form (even if it doesn’t “go” anywhere)
