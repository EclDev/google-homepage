In this project I am attempting to create a basic copy of a google search results page. It will have no JS functionality and no "fany" features like drop down menus etc. This is to test my basic knowlege of HTML and CSS. By the end of this project I should hae a good grasp of:

-Two ways to move a div around on the page
-Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
-Identify the background color of an existing webpage
-Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
-Center an element horizontally
-Three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page
-Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
-Build a very basic form (even if it doesn’t “go” anywhere)

Finishing Notes:
I learned many of the above goals but I need to work on positioning. My page is a decently faithfull recreation of the search results barring the advertising boxes. I feel like I have a better grasp on HTML and CSS and I defniitely know how to research WebDev problems now. My code is definietly spaghetti-like but as I got deeper in the project I learned what I was doing wrong and how to better visualize the work flow and connection between an HTML page and its corresponding CSS styles page. In the future I think using simpler CSS classes and including many of them in the class attributes of HTML tags would be the way to go so there wouldn't be so much repeated code in my CSS page. However for my first project it is pretty good and I am proud to show off what The Odin Project has taught me!
